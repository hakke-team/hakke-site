During August we worked with the newly established community led TD Solar Group based in Dorking. Their main purpose is to increase the take-up of solar energy in and around the town, specifically focusing on opportunities in 3 main areas: commercial, residential, and community solar.

Their needs included the ability to edit content using a CMS, but at the same time keeping the job of maintaining the website a simple one, as the members of the group are mostly non-technical. Due to its complex nature, we ruled out the use of WordPress as our backend and instead decided to take a chance with [Bolt](http://bolt.cm/). We were pleasantly surprised by Bolt's ease of use and how simple it was to integrate with our design. The group were also pleased with how straightforward it is to edit the content.
